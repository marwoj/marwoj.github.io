Have you ever come up with a great idea for a web app but were held back by doubts and fear of spending lots of your
precious time coding – only to learn that nobody can use it? What if the project ends up being another git repository
buried somewhere in the github limbo and waiting indefinitely for it’s turn to come? If you ever had such thoughts, this
skeleton app is for you.

This seed project takes care of the basic EC2 setup, deployment and hosting, allowing you to focus exclusively on your
application’s requirements. For more details and source code visit Github
